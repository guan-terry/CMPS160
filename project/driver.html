  <div id="overview">
      A player will be on an endless map trying to survive as long as they can.
      The goal is to jump over the blocks which are at random size. The more blocks
      the player jumps over, the higher the score will be. The score is accumulated
      by the number of blocks the player jumps over per round. Good Luck!!!

    <p>(L) – User will hold down the letter L to charge a single jump.
      The longer the user holds down L, the higher the jump will be.

  <div id="text">
    <p>If the user holds L for more than 3 seconds, the bottom of the
    canvas will start flashing a color giving the user a warning that the jump
    charge has reached its maximum capacity.</p>

    <p>(M) – The user will be granted a one-time power up in the game. When the
       user is wants to, the user has the ability to press M and this will clear
        all the blocks on the current canvas screen.</p>

  </div>
  <div id="text">
    <p>(Color Picking) – The user will have the ability to change its own color
       into any color the user desires when the user clicks on the square itself.
       The user will also have the ability to change the color of the ground into
        any color when clicking on it. There is a slider that allows the user
        to change either itself or the ground. There is also another separate
        slider that allows the user to change the blocks moving through the
        canvas. </p>

  <div id="text">
    <p>(Heads-up Display) – During the game we plan to have 2 heads up display.
       At the top left corner, we will be displaying 2 things. As the game is
       running, the user will be allowed to see their current score based on the
       number of blocks they’ve jumped over. Also there will be a target score
       in which it keeps track of the users highest score achieved throughout
       the many games the user has played. As a result, the user will not have to
       take its eyes off the canvas during the game when trying to achieve a
       high score.</p>

  <div id="pictures">
    <center><img src="img/features/advance_collision.JPG" height="400px"; width="600px"></center>
  </div>
  <div id="text">
    <p>(Collision Detection) – As the user crashes into a block, the game will
      end. The user as one object, and the blocks as another object. When these
      two objects have collided, there will be a pop up saying "You're a loser",
      and the total score will appear at the top left. Momentarily, the game will
      start again, and the user will have a chance to beat its own score.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="pictures">
    <center><img src="img/features/advance_phong.JPG" height="400px"; width="600px"></center>
  </div>
  <div id="text">
    <p>(Phong Shader) – As the user jumps up and down, there will be a different
    aspect of color depending on the height of the user. As the user jumps, the
    amount of light would intensify. Also the ground has a lighting in which the
    higher up the ground is, the gradient would intensify. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="overview">
    <p>The assignment was used from part of assignment 4's base code. We decided to
    change up the 3d world into a 2d world. As a result, a lot of things had to be
    modified. Rather than implementing an array of blocks, we decided to take the
    approach of loading in random blocks using Math.random. Texturing the user is
    also another thing we've implemented. Using the advanced methods and interactive
    features, we created an endless running canvas which makes up this game, "BIRD JUMP".</p>
